In this lecture, Peng will give a detailed explanation of L1 norm. Especially, the reason of why L1 norm can help get a sparse or robust solution 
is discussed. Based on the discussion, the models of robust PCA, sparse PCA and robust sparse PCA are introduced.

The paper titled "A Robust and Sparse Process Fault Detection Method Based on RSPCA" by Peng is presented.

Hope this work can help you! Good luck~
